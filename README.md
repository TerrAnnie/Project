SOS Game in Java: 



Python Genetic Algorithim:
Project for Intro to Artificial Intelligence. Designed a Genetic Algorithm to create schedules for a given semester. Fitness was determined by many different conditions.
Used Tournament Selection to determine the next generation to avoid overfitting and then used crossover twice (to create two children) from both parents. Population of each generation 500, iterated at least 100 times and the improvement was less that 1%. Mutation rate 1% initially but gradually decreases.
