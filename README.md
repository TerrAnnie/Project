# Projects
Repository For all the Major Projects I've worked on throughout the years

SOS Game in Java: SOS Program created in Java for Software engineering course. Also includes GUI built with Java swing. Also an option for AI players. Records the game and outputs to file once it's over. Users have an option to choose board size and Play with AI as well can also be AI against AI. They can also choose if they want to be red or blue. This project was designed to use agile methodology, along with OOP practices.
Bugs (Features ;) )include lines that are made when a player scores are not always outputted when correct(Link in google drive file is too big for github)



Python Genetic Algorithim:
Project for Intro to Artificial Intelligence. Designed a Genetic Algorithm to create schedules for a given semester. Fitness was determined by many different conditions.
Used Tournament Selection to determine the next generation to avoid overfitting and then used crossover twice (to create two children) from both parents. Population of each generation 500, iterated at least 100 times and the improvement was less that 1%. Mutation rate 1% initially but gradually decreases.


Neural Network Python: Neural Network designed to predict whether or not a patient had heart disease or not CSV Data is included. Created using Tensorflow and Keras. This project required tons of research but most of the code has sources within. Write up is included in the Zip file. This also includes how accurate the the model was at the end of the project.


Senior Capstone Project: Goal was to create a Grader/GTA portal for the university. Students would be able to apply for a grader position for courses, and admins would be able to make listings for courses as well. Was a group Project. The zip includes the PHP, SQL, and HTML/CSS. The webpage connects to the database which stores courses, students, professors, and other information. I mostly worked with PHP and HTML for the duration of the project. Did some Database cleanup work as well.


Afforable Housing Project- Basic Decesion tree for Developers and Clients(Homeowners). Created in Python. 

Parser in Racket-
Parser created in racket sample inputs included in zipfile. Along with additional readme
