Repository For all the Major Projects I've worked on throughout the years

SOS Game in Java: SOS Program created in Java for Software engineering course. Also includes GUI built with Java swing. Also an option for AI players. Records the game and outputs to file once it's over. Users have an option to choose board size and Play with AI as well can also be AI against AI. They can also choose if they want to be red or blue. This project was designed to use agile methodology, along with OOP practices.
Bugs (Features ;) )include lines that are made when a player scores are not always outputted when correct



Python Genetic Algorithim:
Project for Intro to Artificial Intelligence. Designed a Genetic Algorithm to create schedules for a given semester. Fitness was determined by many different conditions.
Used Tournament Selection to determine the next generation to avoid overfitting and then used crossover twice (to create two children) from both parents. Population of each generation 500, iterated at least 100 times and the improvement was less that 1%. Mutation rate 1% initially but gradually decreases.
